# saker.jar

Build tasks and supporting classes for the [saker.build system](https://saker.build) for creating Java Archives during build. The tasks use the [saker.zip](https://github.com/sakerbuild/saker.zip) package behind the scenes, but add additional functionality for convenient JAR creation. (E.g. manifest and service declaration, multi-release support, etc...)

See the [documentation](https://saker.build/saker.jar/doc/) for more information.
